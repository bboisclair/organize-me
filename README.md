# Organize-Me
The purpose of this script is for organizing a folder and all of the contents from within that folder. The script creates several folders in whatever directory it is run against and moves files with specific extensions to their corresponding folder. 

This is my first project to be posted on GitHub.

# Requirements
The script only uses standard python modules so there is no need to install aditional modules. The script itself requires a Python interpreter to run.

# How to use
I run this on Windows 10 so I normally will open up CMD and then cd to the directory which holds my organize.py script. Once in that directory, I run "python organize.py 'directory I want to run against' "
  --> For example: python organize.py C:\Users\Brandon\Downloads
  
# Important Information
Depending on the size of your folder, it can take quite a while for all the files to move/organize during the first run. Don't terminate the script while it's running because that may corrupt some of your files.
